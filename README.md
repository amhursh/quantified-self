# Introduction

Quantified Self is a simple calorie tracker.

This was a joint project between [Brandon Stewart](https://github.com/boveus) and [Aaron Hursh](https://github.com/amhursh).  This project involved building a front-end using Javascript and jQuery to create a single-page application(SAP).  The application consumes a RESTful API, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/boveus/quantified-api). The backend portion of the application was created with Express in Node.js using the Knex library to perform SQL queries. This project was completed over the course of two weeks.
